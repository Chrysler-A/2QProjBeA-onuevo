					<p>Northern lights, or also known as aurora borealis, are naturally occuring phenomenons near the north pole. This occurs when energy of the Sun interacts with the Earth's atmosphere which has many different gases like nitrogen and oxygen. The Sun constantly releases charged particles like protons and electrons travelling away from the Sun with speeds of about one million miles per hour. When these speedy particles hits Earth, they are directed by the Earth's magnetic field to the north and south poles. Then when these particles enter Earth's upper	atmosphere, they collide with atmoshperic gases and emits light that forms the aurora.</p>

					<p>Fun fact: no two auroras are alike—each has a unique size, shape, and color. The color of the light depends on the color of the gas it interacts with and no two gases give off exactly the same colors. The most common aurora is made of yellow green light, and it's a result of the collision with oxygen at altitudes about 100 to 300km. The coloe of the aurora could also depend from the height. Collisions with oxygen at altitudes more than 300km produce a rare red light.</p>
